<!--Imagine you're building a basic profile page for a user on a small website. Create a script that:
Stores the user's name, age, and whether they are an admin using variables.
Checks whether the user is old enough to access admin features (age should be 18 or more and user must be admin).
Use the conditional ? : operator to display either "Access Granted" or "Access Denied" based on the condition.
Display the result only when a button is clicked.
Also check if the "age" property exists in the user object using the "in" operator.
Delete the "age" property after the check using the delete operator-->

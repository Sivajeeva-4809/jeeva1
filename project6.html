<!--You are working on a simple "Student Result Dashboard" for a school's internal website. You are given an array of student objects where each student has a name and score. Your tasks are:

List all student names.

Create a new array that shows only the names of students who scored more than 60.

Find the total score of all students.

Check if all students passed (score > 35).

Check if at least one student scored more than 90.

Sort the students by their score in descending order and display their names along with scores.-->
